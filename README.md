DPR 212 Final Project

This project came about by wanting to add a more updated look, and more functionality to a church website that was last updated over 5 years ago. The site was originally built on WordPress but other than the content we really couldn't change anything.
<br><br>
Another dilemma was it was hard to edit the live site while it was live. One wrong character or bracket and the whole site goes down. So early on in the process I figured I need to be able to edit a local copy of the site. I had installed WordPress on my computer many times before using WampServer, but I was looking for way to gain more control over the site.
<br><br>
I'm pretty savvy with Dreamweaver, so I figured I should be able to edit the site in real time using Dreamweaver instead of using the web-based version of WordPress. The great thing about Dreamweaver is as I made changes and saw that they worked and didn't mess anything up, I could just push those files right to the online server.
<br><br>
So here is how I got everything going:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Download WampServer (http://www.wampserver.com/en/)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Double click on the downloaded file and just follow the instructions. Everything is automatic. The WampServer package is delivered whith the latest releases of Apache, MySQL and PHP.</li>
		<li>Once WampServer is installed, you can manually add aditionals Apache, Php or MySql (only VC9, VC10 and VC11 compiled) versions. Explanations will be provided on the forum.</li>
		<li>Each release of Apache, MySQL and PHP has its own settings and its own files (datas for MySQL).</li>
	<ul>
</ul>
